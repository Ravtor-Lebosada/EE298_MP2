# EE298 Machine Problem 2: Polynomial Solver

This repository utilizes TinyGrad as framework for learning degrees and coefficients.

Note: This is done via google colab, link is here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1txkT0EOqKkGbOgY_n_EqYy6pZ27KEzUx#scrollTo=_25y0A-0KnGX

Python file: solver.py is done without checking if it is working since TinyGrad cannot be set up on my device.
